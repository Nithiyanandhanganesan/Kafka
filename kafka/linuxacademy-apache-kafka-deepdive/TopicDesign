Points to consider while designing the topic:
- design topic based on use cases for maximum performance.
- Two main consideration are :
  - Partitions
  - ReplicationFactor

- number of brokers limit the number of replicas.
- higher replication factor means greater fault tolerance.
- how many consumer to place in a consumer group for parallel processing. here we need to have as many as partition as the
  number of consumer in the consumer group.
- how much memory available on each broker. kafka requires memory to process the messages. replica.fetch.max.bytes (Default 1MB) determines
  rough amount of memory you will need for each partition on a broker.

Metrics & Monitoring:
=====================
- both kafka and zookeeper offers metrics through JMX.
- we can access metrics from kafka brokers as well as kafka client.
