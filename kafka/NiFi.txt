Best alternative to Kafka connect is Nifi.
Kafka connect is used to connect to external datastore and submit the data to producer.
Nifi does the same. It connects to external datastore and gives the data to kafka producer. But Nifi has some advanced feature.

NIFI has a very extensible framework, allowing any developers/users to add a data source connector quite easily. 
In the previous release, NIFI 1.0, we had 170+ processors bundled with the application by default, including the twitter processor.

NiFi has a concept called expression language which is supported on a per-property basis, meaning the developer of a processor can choose whether a property 
supports expression language. NiFi’s expression language is documented here: https://nifi.apache.org/docs/nifi-docs/html/expression-language-guide.html

NiFi is implemented in the Java programming language and allows extensions (processors, controller services, and reporting tasks) to be implemented in Java. 
In addition, NiFi supports processors that execute scripts written in Groovy, Jython, and several other popular scripting languages.
